# React Native Animated Ball Game

## About the Game

The Ball Animation Expo Game is a mobile app developed with React Native and powered by Expo, featuring a simple yet engaging gameplay where players control a ball's movement by tilting their device. The game utilizes device motion sensors to provide a real-life gaming experience, making it an excellent showcase of React Native's capabilities and the use of animations.

## Features
